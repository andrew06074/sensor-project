# Overview
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate an understanding of the data science lifecycle. I am using a sensor dataset due to their high usage in industrial settings and supply chain management. I begin with an exploratory analysis of the data set with the end goal of creating an interactive data science tool. While not every data science project requires this kind of development, I wanted to learn the streamlit library as a bi-product of this project.
